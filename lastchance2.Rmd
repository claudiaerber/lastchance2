# **Statistical Analysis of Behavioral Data**

I need to learn how to use RStudio and RMarkdown as part of my PhD course.  
Dead line 02/06/2023



## **Session Summary 1:**

- Exercise 1 very difficult, watch the videos many times before hands on, and lost time
- Exercise 2 it feels little bit easier, but had problems to find some symbols in my pc
- Exercise 3 I got to solve the symbols problem and I used the link with the answers to get more familiar with the R language
- Exercise 4 R Markdown still a challenge at moment but I like it!

## **Session Summary 2:**
-problem to get the doc.rmd in Git tab
-created many repositories in Github
